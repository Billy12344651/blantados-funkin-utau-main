# All of Blantados' FNF MOD UTAUS!

Here are all the UTAU voicebanks I use for my videos! Feel free to use them for your own covers! Side Note: Some voicebanks don't work with certain resamplers. You have to download a few other resamplers, specifically fresamp, bkh01, and TIPS. Download links to those down below!

The main voicebanks by GenoX are not included here so you have to download them on his page!

Please credit me if you end up using these voicebanks.
